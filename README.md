<h1>Cybersecurity Risk Assessment & Treatment Plan for E-Commerce Company</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

During my time at the company, I led a project focused on assessing risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of critical assets and developing a treatment plan aligned with ISO 27001 standards.

<h2>Key Actions</h2>

### Risk Assessment
As part of the risk assessment, I defined the scope to include systems supporting customer and financial data, compiled an asset register covering databases, web servers, and payment platforms, and aligned the identified assets with regulatory requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. 

### Threat & Vulnerability Analysis
During the threat and vulnerability analysis, I flagged potential risks including malware targeting payment infrastructure, DDoS attacks against web servers, and insider abuse of customer data, while also recording vulnerabilities such as obsolete antivirus solutions, the absence of a web application firewall, and excessive privilege assignments

### Risk Evaluation
I then carried out a qualitative risk evaluation using a likelihood and impact matrix, which resulted in phishing-related breaches and SQL injection being ranked as high priority risks, while DDoS attacks were classified as medium-level threats requiring targeted mitigation. 

### Risk Treatment
For risk treatment, I reduced risks through email filtering, multi-factor authentication, and systematic patching; eliminated risks by decommissioning insecure third-party integrations; transferred risks through cyber insurance and updated cloud service contracts; and accepted low-level risks with minimal business impact.

Based on ISO 27001 Annex A (2022), I also recommended specific security controls. These included rolling out an enterprise-wide information security policy, applying role-based access control to limit insider exposure, launching a structured patch management program, and instituting recurring compliance audits and monitoring routines.

<h2>Results & Impact</h2>
The outcomes of this engagement were tangible. I provided leadership with a clear, ISO aligned perspective of the companyâ€™s cyber risk posture, delivered a prioritized treatment roadmap that balanced mitigation with business objectives, reinforced compliance readiness for PCI DSS and GDPR assessments, and enabled strategic investment in security by directly linking risks to business outcomes.
