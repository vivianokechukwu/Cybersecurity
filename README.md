<h1>Cybersecurity Risk Assessment & Treatment Plan - E-Commerce Company</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I was engaged as a cybersecurity consultant to strengthen the security posture of a growing e-commerce company that processed high volumes of customer transactions and stored sensitive financial data. The project focused on assessing risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of critical assets and developing a treatment plan aligned with ISO 27001 standards.

<h2>Key Actions</h2>

### Risk Assessment (ISO 27001 Guidelines):

- Defined scope to systems handling customer and financial data.<br>
- Conducted asset inventory (databases, web servers, payment systems).<br>
- Mapped regulatory obligations (PCI DSS, GDPR).

### Threat & Vulnerability Analysis:

- Identified risks including malware on payment systems, DDoS against web servers, insider misuse of customer databases.<br>
- Documented vulnerabilities such as outdated antivirus, lack of WAF, and excessive user permissions.

### Risk Evaluation:

- Applied qualitative risk matrix (likelihood × impact).<br>
- Prioritized phishing-based breaches and SQL injection as “High” risks.<br>
- Classified DDoS as a “Medium” risk requiring mitigation.

### Risk Treatment Planning:

- **Mitigation:** Email filtering, MFA, patch management.<br>
- **Avoidance:** Remove insecure 3rd-party integrations.<br>
- **Transfer:** Cyber insurance and cloud service agreements.<br>
- **Acceptance:** Low-impact risks with minimal exposure.

### Security Control Recommendations (ISO 27001 Annex A, 2022):

- **A.5 Policies:** Implement enterprise-wide Information Security Policy.<br>
- **A.9 Access Control:** Enforce RBAC to reduce insider risk.<br>
- **A.12 Operations Security:** Establish formal Patch Management Program.<br>
- **A.18 Compliance:** Schedule periodic compliance audits and monitoring.

<h2>Results & Impact</h2>

- Provided leadership with a structured, ISO-aligned view of cyber risks.<br>
- Delivered a prioritized treatment roadmap, balancing mitigation with business realities.<br>
- Strengthened compliance posture ahead of PCI DSS and GDPR reviews.<br>
- Enabled proactive security investment by linking risks to business impact.
